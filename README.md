# Integrative kinetics
Standard functions for sampling of Bayesian integrative kinetic models with HDX and TrIQ data


This repository contains the basic funtions that implement the sampling of posterior distributions of thermodynamic and kinetic models based on structual data from molecular dynamics simulations and pulsed HDX-MS data as well as TrIQ data.
